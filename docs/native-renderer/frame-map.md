# Fable 2 frame map and sub-project 3 recommendation

Status: menu half complete (real capture); gameplay half pending (see "Pending: gameplay capture").
Capture used: `out\build\win-amd64-release\logs\d3d_census_20261001_130522.jsonl` (600 rows, main menu / attract only). Row 1 accumulates every call since process start and is dropped by `summarize_census.py`, leaving 599 frames.

Notes:
- `Score` is the opcode-sequence similarity for fuzzy matches and for near misses; a `none` row with a
  candidate in Notes is a rejected near miss (best candidate too close to the runner-up), not a match.
- `Via` is `strict`/`loose` when every ancestor of a call-graph row was an exact match, else `fuzzy`;
  call-graph rows under a fuzzy ancestor are accepted only if the callee pair itself scores >= 0.85.
- `Verified` is yes when the row was compared by side-by-side disassembly.
- Rows with confidence `none` have no confirmed Fable 2 address.


## 1b. Draw function identification

Question: which Fable 2 function is the real `D3DDevice_DrawIndexedVertices` (Skate 3 `0x82B7AD68`)? The signature matcher rejected `0x8221E0F0` (score 0.969, runner-up 0.870) only by the margin rule, and the census never saw it called.

**Census facts (menu, 599 frames).** `D3DDevice_SetIndices` (0x8219CCD8) was called 385 times in total, from exactly one call site: LR `0x821B6F50`. So there are not three callers to rank; there is one. (`D3DDevice_SetStreamSource` has 7 sites; the top two, `0x821CB1A8` and `0x821CB120`, have 4401 calls each.)

**Containing function of the only SetIndices caller.** `.pdata` start `0x821B6EC0`, 43 instructions (172 bytes). Disassembly (`python tools\xdk_sigmatch\sigmatch.py disasm out\xdk\fable2 0x821B6F40 12`): four `bl 0x821B6DA0` (SetStreamSource), then `li r4,0; lwz r3,0x19c(r31); bl 0x8219CCD8` (SetIndices with a null buffer), then `bl 0x821B6F70` and `bl 0x821B5358`, then the epilogue.

`bl` targets after the SetIndices call within that function:

| Call site | Target | Size | Fuzzy score vs Skate 3 DrawIndexedVertices | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x821B6F50 | 0x821B6F70 | 44 instrs | 0.168 | loops over 0x14 per-slot table entries; calls `0x821B7020` for empty slots (clears bound slots) |
| 0x821B6F54 | 0x821B5358 | 51 instrs | 0.195 | similar slot-clearing loop, calls `0x82B60D10` and `0x821B7020` |

Neither is a draw (Skate 3 DrawIndexedVertices is 277 instructions). Conclusion: `0x821B6EC0` is a "reset stream sources / index buffer / bound slots" function, and the census SetIndices hits are null resets, not per-draw binds. SetIndices is therefore not a usable anchor for finding the indexed draw in the menu.

**Best candidates for DrawIndexedVertices, scanning every Fable 2 function within +/-40% of 277 instrs by fuzzy opcode-sequence score:**

| Fable 2 function | Instrs | Fuzzy score | Static `bl` callers | Seen in menu census |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x8221E0F0 | 276 | 0.969 | 8 (in functions `0x821A3AE8`, `0x821DDF70`, `0x821FEA90`, `0x8221BCC8`, `0x8221EBC0`, `0x82225CC8`, `0x82B21448`, `0x82FE8AF0`) | never called |
| 0x8221C518 | 252 | 0.870 | 11 | 4401 calls (the hooked `DrawVertices?`) |
| 0x82217EE8 | 327 | 0.785 | not checked | not hooked |
| 0x8221C9C8 | 259 | 0.784 | not checked | not hooked |

Evidence that `0x8221C518` is a real draw function (DrawVertices-style): it is called from `0x821CA7E8` (626-instr function) at `0x821CB188`, immediately before that function's `bl 0x821B6DA0` (SetStreamSource unbind) at `0x821CB1A4`, the draw-then-unbind order; its body calls SetRenderState (0x8221C908) 8 times and AluConstants (0x8221DF98) twice, and the SetRenderState LR `0x8221C60C` (4398 calls) lies inside it, matching its 4401 calls.

**Verdict.** `0x8221E0F0` remains the most likely real `D3DDevice_DrawIndexedVertices`: one instruction different in size from the Skate 3 function (276 vs 277), 0.969 similarity, and the next-best candidate is a different (non-indexed) function. Confidence: medium (about 65%). It is unconfirmed because the menu never executes it; gameplay should hit it if it is correct. `0x8221C518` is, at medium-high confidence (about 80%), `D3DDevice_DrawVertices` (call-site evidence above, 0.986 similarity to Skate 3's DrawVertices per the xdk-map). Neither hook explains the steady menu draw rate (section 2): hooked draw calls cover only part of `gpu.draws`.

Recommendation (no hook edits made in this task): re-run `gen_census_hooks` with an annotation promoting `0x8221E0F0` and `0x8221C518` to named draw hooks, add census hooks for `0x82217EE8` and `0x8221C9C8`, and capture a gameplay run. If `0x8221E0F0` still never fires, the indexed draw is inlined at its call sites or reached through a different entry.

Reading the numbers:
- Median frame is 26 emulated draws, 25 on pitch 1280 and 1 on pitch 640; one resolve per frame.
- `DrawVertices?` fires in only about 117 of 599 frames (4401 calls in total, up to 59 per frame; those frames also have many more total draws, median 281, versus 33 DrawVertices? calls). In 482 of the 597 frames that have any draw, no hooked draw function was called at all. The ratio line above (median 0.0) therefore means the hooked draw functions explain little of the steady draw stream (about 12% in frames where DrawVertices? fires).
- `DrawIndexedVertices?` (0x8221E0F0) never fired. SetIndices only appears as null resets (section 1b).

## 3. Gameplay frame / 4. Pass list

See "Pending: gameplay capture" below.

## 5. CPU vs GPU emulation

What the menu supports (599 frames):

| Quantity | Median | Mean |
|---|---|---|
| guest frame time (`guest_ms`) | 34.19 ms | 35.87 ms |
| swap interval (`swap_interval_ms`) | 33.60 ms | 35.94 ms |
| emulated IssueDraw CP time (`draw_cpu_ms`) | 0.186 ms (max 19.5 ms) | 0.276 ms |
| resolve CP time (`copy_cpu_ms`) | 0.022 ms | 0.049 ms |

Draw plus copy emulation costs about 0.2 ms of a 33.6 ms frame (under 1%, at median and at mean). Guest frame time tracks the swap interval (within about 0.6 ms at the median, 0.1 ms at the mean), both near 33.3 ms: a 30 Hz vsync-locked menu. So the menu is not emulation-bound; the frame is dominated by waiting (vsync / guest pacing), not command-processor work. This says nothing about gameplay: the menu issues 26 draws per frame, gameplay will issue far more, and `draw_cpu_ms` scales with draws (a 19.5 ms spike already appears in a busy menu frame). Gameplay data is required for the real CPU-vs-GPU answer; the decision rule is in the pending section.

## 6. Engine submission sites

Top callers of the hooked functions, mapped to the containing `.pdata` function (largest start <= LR):

| Hooked function | Top LR | Calls | Containing function | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DrawVertices? 0x8221C518 | 0x821CB18C | 4401 | 0x821CA7E8 (626 instrs) | only observed draw site; same function then unbinds stream 0 (LR 0x821CB1A8) and, earlier, binds via 0x82220D38 (LR 0x821CB120, inside 0x82220A18, apparently a SetStreamSource-forwarding thunk) |
| SetStreamSource 0x821B6DA0 | 0x821CB1A8, 0x821CB120 | 4401 each | 0x821CA7E8 | one bind and one unbind per draw |
| SetStreamSource | 0x821B6F44/F28/F0C/EF0 | 385 each | 0x821B6EC0 (43 instrs) | state-reset function, null binds |
| SetIndices 0x8219CCD8 | 0x821B6F50 | 385 | 0x821B6EC0 | the only SetIndices site in the menu |
| SetRenderState 0x8221C908 | 0x8221C60C | 4398 | 0x8221C518 | inside DrawVertices? |
| BeginVertices? 0x822060A0 | 0x821EBFD4 | 1342 | 0x821EBDA0 (154 instrs) | not a draw confirmation |
| SetPixelShader? 0x822324E0 | 0x8222C2FC, 0x822324C8 | 2528, 2056 | 0x8222C268, 0x82232468 | |
| SetVertexShader? 0x82208CE8 | 0x82208CDC, 0x82220A00 | 3928, 2061 | 0x82208C48, 0x822209A0 | |

`0x821CA7E8` is the first engine submission function to capture for sub-project 3 (menu draw path).

## 7. Recommendation for sub-project 3 (PROVISIONAL, pending gameplay data)

Based only on the main menu capture and the identified functions:

1. **Draw function to capture first:** `D3DDevice_DrawVertices?` at `0x8221C518`, reached from engine submission function `0x821CA7E8` (caller LR `0x821CB18C`). It is the only draw entry that provably executes. Verify `0x8221E0F0` as DrawIndexedVertices in gameplay before building an indexed path on it.
2. **First pass to replace:** the dominant pitch-1280 pass (25 of 26 draws in the menu; in gameplay it is expected to include the main scene, but it is unproven that it is plain world geometry). Use `--native_render_suppress_pitches=1280` only after the gameplay pass list (section 4) confirms the world pass has its own pitch; if shadow or scene targets share 1280, suppression must be narrowed by draw index instead.
3. **`native_render_keep_pitches`:** provisionally `640` (the single half-resolution draw; likely a post/downsample pass) so the existing frame still presents; revisit once pitches 320/160/560/280 (median 0 in the menu) are characterised in gameplay.
4. **Coverage warning:** hooked draw calls do not account for most `gpu.draws`. Before a native renderer can replace a pass, the unhooked draw submission path must be found (re-run `gen_census_hooks` with annotations for the draw candidates in section 1b, plus hooks on the callers of `0x8221E0F0`).
5. Emulation cost is negligible in the menu (section 5); the performance case for or against a native renderer waits for gameplay.

All of the above is provisional until the pending gameplay capture is filled in.

## Pending: gameplay capture

Needs the user to load a save in the game (cannot be automated). Results fill sections 3, 4, the gameplay half of 5, and finalise 7.

1. Capture (separate run, after loading a save and standing in the world):
```
$env:FABLE2_D3D_CENSUS = "900"
& .\out\build\win-amd64-release\fable_2.exe
```
   Stop the process after the log reports completion; the file lands in `out\build\win-amd64-release\logs\d3d_census_<timestamp>.jsonl`.
2. Summarize:
```
python tools\xdk_sigmatch\summarize_census.py out\build\win-amd64-release\logs\d3d_census_<gameplay>.jsonl > gameplay.md
```
   Paste `gameplay.md` into section 3.
3. Ablation, one run per significant pitch `<p>` from gameplay.md (emulated frames, no native renderer):
```
& .\out\build\win-amd64-release\fable_2.exe --native_render_suppress_debug=true --native_render_suppress_pitches=<p>
```
   Record, per pitch, its median draw count and what disappears or breaks on screen; name each pass (shadow map, main scene, water, post, UI).
4. Fill in:
   - Section 4: table `pitch | draws | observed effect when suppressed | pass name`.
   - Section 5: if `draw_cpu_ms_median` plus the other command-processor work is a large fraction of `swap_interval_ms_median` and `guest_ms_median` tracks the swap interval, emulation-bound; if `guest_ms_median` is far above the swap interval with low draw CPU time, guest-CPU-bound.
   - Section 6: gameplay top callers (check whether `0x8221E0F0` is hit, and by which LR).
   - Section 7: replace the provisional text with the largest plain-world-geometry pass, its pitch for `native_render_suppress_pitches`, the pitches for `native_render_keep_pitches`, and the draw function plus caller to capture first.
